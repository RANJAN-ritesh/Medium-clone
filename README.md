# Medium-clone
Hi Everyone,
So as a Project for Our Unit 5 Construct week in Masai School we have created a Blog post website taking inspiration from the Medium.com website.
# Intro
We are a team of five members including Abhishek Singh, Roshan Jambhulkar, Aditya Prakash Mishra, Mitesh Sawant, and me.
we created the website in 5 days using a wide array of Tech Stack including ReactJS, Redux, CSS, and Firebase as an authentication platform.
# The Project
The project starts with a homepage where we have fetched the data from JSON server and rendered it with the help of ReactJS and Redux.
After that, there is a login section which is done with the help of the Firebase authentication system which gives security and oAuth features.
Further, you can add your articles after you are logged in and they will be saved in the database and will be accessible any time you log in to the
website also you can filter the various articles shown by their tag names.
